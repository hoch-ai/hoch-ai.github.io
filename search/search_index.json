Hoch is a flexible container format for all kinds of generative art. With Hoch, you can create, share, and archive your art projects using a single file. Hoch's design supports both long-term preservation and provenance of generative art, allowing you to work with the confidence that you'll always be able to recreate it and remix it. Features Portability : Hoch files are self-contained and can be easily shared and archived. Flexibility : Hoch supports a wide range of generative art projects, from simple images or text, to complex audiovisual workflows. Interoperation : Hoch is designed to work with many tools and workflows, from the ground up. This includes both new AI-enabled tools like InvokeAI and traditional tools like Inkscape. Preservation : Hoch files are designed to be future-proof, ensuring that your art will be accessible for years to come. Using best practice metadata standards for digital preservation, each file contains enough information that even if the original applications are no longer available, the art can still be recreated if necessary. Provenance : Hoch files contain metadata that can be used to track the history of the art, including the original authors and licensing of any assets or models used in the project. This makes it simple to comply with standard moral and legal principles when creating generative works. About the name Hoch's name comes from the German word for \"high\". The first, and more boring reason for choosing this name is that Hoch aims to set a high standard for generative art preservation and provenance. Additionally, generative tools are enabling more of us to become art directors rather than draftspeople. This opens the door to more people being able to express themselves through art. The more important reason is in honor of Hannah H\u00f6ch , a pivotal artist in the creation of remix art through photomontage. H\u00f6ch's work was a key part of the Dada movement, which sought to break down the boundaries between art and everyday life. Hoch aims to continue this tradition by making it easy for artists to remix and reimagine their own work, as well as the work of others, to create a dynamic artistic conversation that spans time and space.","title":"Hoch: Reimagine.
